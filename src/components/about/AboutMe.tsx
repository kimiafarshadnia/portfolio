                    My main interest lies in the world of blockchain, the metaverse, and NFTs. Designing and implementing NFT Marketplace websites is particularly exciting for me due to their innovative and visually appealing nature. Therefore, I am currently learning Three.js to create outstanding 3D experiences on the web.
                </p>


                <p>
                    I am fluent in French, which allows me to access a wider range of resources and collaborate with French-speaking clients. While working, I often listen to Indian music, which energizes and focuses me. Additionally, I enjoy videos and podcasts about improving lifestyle and leveling up, as they help me increase productivity and the quality of my work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to combine technical knowledge and creativity to create unique and innovative projects that not only meet users’ needs but also provide them with unforgettable experiences.
